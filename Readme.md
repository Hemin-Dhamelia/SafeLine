# SafeLine — AI-Powered Fraud Call Detection System

SafeLine is an AI-driven fraud call detection system designed to identify and prevent phone-based scams, with a specific focus on SSN and immigration-related fraud. The project applies PMBOK-aligned project management practices to design, plan, and deliver a scalable, real-time fraud detection MVP.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Phone scams continue to cause billions in financial losses each year. Traditional call-blocking solutions are reactive and lack real-time intelligence. SafeLine addresses this gap by combining telecom integrations, AI/ML-based fraud detection, and user-facing alerts to proactively protect users from fraudulent calls.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect fraudulent calls in real time using AI-driven analysis
- Integrate securely with telecom APIs for caller verification
- Generate risk scores to classify calls as legitimate or fraudulent
- Notify users instantly with actionable alerts
- Provide analytics and reporting for transparency and insights
- Ensure privacy, security, and regulatory compliance

---

## 🧠 Solution Architecture (High-Level Flow)

1. Incoming call data captured via telecom APIs
2. Caller metadata and verification signals analyzed
3. AI/ML models compute a fraud risk score
4. Calls classified as **Legitimate** or **Fraudulent**
5. Real-time alerts delivered to users
6. Analytics dashboards provide reporting and insights
